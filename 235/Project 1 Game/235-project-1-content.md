# Project 1 Game Design Document
## Ethan Ruhl IGME 235

### High Concept
Players can race against the clock or another player locally and boost into eachother to try and knock them off the track, however the boost will have a cooldown. The player will be able to bost a little by tapping the boost button without penalty, or they can hold to charge it for a greater boost. However, if they miss with a bigger boost, the player is "stunned" for a second before they can resume racing. A highscore board will be kept in a text file and displayed on screen in the main menu.

### Genre
Racing, Retro Arcade

### Platform
Desktop only

A great enemy has arisen, threatening all life on earth! Legend has foretold that a hero will be chosen through the noble art of racing! Will you be the hero that the world needs, or will others vanquish your times?
