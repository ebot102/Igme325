    <p>Hi! I'm Ethan Ruhl, a second year game design and development student at RIT! Ever since I was a kid I've loved playing videogames
        and have always known that I would want to make them myself one day! That is the main goal of my studies, however I would also like to learn
        about sound production in games as well, as I have been a saxophone player for 10 years and that is my other main passion. In 235, I hope to gain
        more knowledge about the inner workings of web development to better implement web-based games. When I graduate I would
        like to enter the game industry and work on game development.
